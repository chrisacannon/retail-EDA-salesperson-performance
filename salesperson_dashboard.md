The dashboard will focus on 3 KPIs: Revenue per Category, Location, and Campaign. It will compare the top performing segment of each KPI with the next highest performing segment as a means of spotting areas where individual salespeople are more proficient. The dashboard includes a drop-down search menu to select a salesperson. It is easily to tweak and configure in the future if goals need to be adjusted.
